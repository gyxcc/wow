					<p>It is important to be cautious and aware of the potential risks of fraud. By recognizing the
						signs of fraud and following the safety guides, you can prevent yourself from being a victim of
						fraud. Here are some tips on how to recognize the signs of fraud and how to prevent it.</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Recognizing Suspicious Signs</h2>

					<p>There are several signs that can help you recognize a potential fraud. Here are some of the most
						common signs:</p>

					<h3>Check the message or phone call source</h3>
					<p>
						Check the incoming number when receiving a phone call or message which claims to be from a
						company. Be careful if the source differs from the one you previously received. Most (83.7% and
						79.5%) interviewees can identify fraudulent messages and phone calls by the incoming number,
						respectively.
					</p>

					<h3>Check the style of the message</h3>
					<p>
						The use of words, tone, or writing style of the message looks significantly different from other
						messages you’ve received from the company. If the message contains a link, be cautious if the
						link in a message looks similar but does not match the correct company website URL, where 70.5%
						of interviewees can identify fraudulent messages through the difference in the URL.
					</p>

					<h3>Check the content of the message</h3>
					<p>
						Usually, the company does not request that you provide any confidential information, such as
						account passwords, one-time passwords, or credit card information. It might be a sign of
						fraudulent activity if the phone call or message requests your personal information.
					</p>

					<h3>Be cautious with over-attractive returns</h3>
					<p>
						When the investment return is attractive with low or no risk, you have to be careful about that.
						It is unlikely to have a high return with no risk. It is better to verify that the investment is
						licensed. Unlicensed investments with high returns might be a sign of fraud, and you might lose
						all your money.
					</p>

					<h2>Safety Guides</h2>

					<p>It is important to learn how to prevent frauds by correct way to surf on Internet. Here is some
						suggestions on how to prevent frauds.</p>

					<h3>Avoiding unknown links and attachments</h3>
					<p>People should be aware of unusual messages. Refrain from pressing the unknown link or downloading
						the unknown attachment file received from unfamiliar sources. It may lead to phishing websites
						or downloading malware, where the phishing website can be difficult to identify since it may
						have a similar interface and flow to legitimate sites (75% of interviewees who cannot identify
						fraudulent messages are confused by the interface of the phishing website).</p>
					<p>The government has introduced a policy to add the "#" symbol to the sender of SMS messages sent
						from verified sources, such as verified banks or verified companies, to help identify fraudulent
						messages. Be especially careful if the sender of the SMS you receive does not include the "#".

							target="_blank">here</a> to know more.</p>

					<h3>Regularly updating passwords</h3>
					<p>People should use a unique password for each account and periodically update the password. Strong
						passwords containing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters are
						recommended to lower the risk of the password being cracked. Never use a password already
						exposed or labelled as a “common password”. You might click <a
							href="https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/" target="_blank">here</a> to check
						the strength of your password.</p>

					<h3>Using two-factor authentication</h3>
					<p>People should verify their identity by using two or more authentication factors. Also, one-time
						passwords should be used. It could prevent hackers from accessing the account even if the
						password is already exposed.</p>

					<h3>Being cautious with personal information</h3>
					<p>People should not overshare their personal information through social media since it might be
						used by hackers to predict your identity and password combination. Besides, people should not
						share any sensitive information with anyone, such as passwords, financial information, or
						personal information, through the Internet or email. If a website requests personal information,
						input fake data to check if it verifies the information correctly as fraudulent websites won't.
					</p>

					<h3>Using antivirus software</h3>
					<p>People should use antivirus software, anti-spyware software, firewalls, and online phishing
						website checkers. It can help to detect harmful websites and malware to prevent unauthorized
						access to the data. People can also scan the file with secure software before opening it to
						ensure it is safe to use.</p>

					<h3>Using secure Wi-Fi networks</h3>
					<p>It is recommended that Wi-Fi networks be connected to trustworthy sources and password-secured
						networks. When using public or free Wi-Fi, be cautious not to access sensitive services, such as
						online banking, or online payment, since hackers within the same network might easily retrieve
						your information by your activity. If such activities are needed, use a trustworthy VPN to
						ensure the connection is protected.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>It is important to be cautious and aware of the potential risks of fraud. By recognizing the
						signs of fraud and following the safety guides, you can prevent yourself from being a victim of
						fraud. If you suspect that you have been a victim of fraud, report it to the police and the
						company involved immediately. Remember, prevention is always better than cure.</p>
