						<h2>1.2 Why is fraud happening?</h2>
						<p>
						<h3>At its core, individuals or companies engaged in fraud exploit <span class="highlight2">the
								difference in information available</span>; particularly,
							the <span class="highlight2">expense</span> of checking and confirming this information can
							be substantial enough to discourage a thorough investment in
							fraud prevention measures.</h3>
						</p>
						<img src="images\types of fraud.png" alt="" class="wrap-around">

						<hr class="major" />

						<h2>1.3 Terms you must know</h2>
						<p>
						<h3><span class="highlight">Social engineering</span> employs manipulative strategies to exploit
							<span class="highlight2">human weakness</span> and acquire sensitive information,
							privileges, or valuable assets. In the realm of cybercrime, this entails deceiving online
							users into engaging in risky
							behaviors. Perpetrated by "human hackers", these schemes often entrap unsuspecting users
							into <span class="highlight2">divulging data</span>,
							<span class="highlight2">disseminating malware</span>, or granting <span
								class="highlight2">unauthorized access</span> to secure systems.<br />
							<div class="space-between1"></div>
							<p>
							<h3>Cybercriminals meticulously follow a structured process in duping their targets, known
								as <span class="highlight">the deception cycle</span>. The
								social engineering deception cycle typically encompasses these stages:</h3><br /></p>
							<div class="space-between2"></div>
							<p>
							<h3>1. <span class="highlight">Reconnaissance</span>: Gathering pertinent background
								intelligence about the target individual or entity.<br />
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								2. <span class="highlight">Penetration</span>: Establishing an initial rapport to foster
								trust and subsequently initiating interactions.<br />
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								3. <span class="highlight">Exploitation of vulnerabilities</span>: Leveraging
								established trust and identified weaknesses to launch targeted attacks.<br />
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								4. <span class="highlight">Extraction</span>: Swiftly withdrawing upon successful
								attainment of the desired objective from the victim.
							</h3>
							</p>

							<hr class="major" />

							<h2>2.Types of fraud</h2>
							<p>
							<h3>"Traditional phone calls remain effective for targeting victims, yet modern fraudsters
								often exploit the internet, using
								deceptive images, fabricated stories, and promises of wealth or love to ensnare people
								more efficiently."</h3>
							<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\Amount of loss.png"
										alt="" /></span></div>
							<h2>Let's compare the <span class="highlight3">old</span> and <span
									class="highlight3">new</span> methods of fraud!</h2>

							<h2>2.1 Triditional Fraud</h2>

							<h3><span class="highlight4">2.1.1 Online shopping:</span></h3>
							<h3>It exploiting the consumer's desire for a bargain by offering options that appear to be
								<span class="highlight5">cost-effective</span>.<br />

								For example: counterfeit coupons requesting personal information; <span
									class="highlight2">fake vouchers</span>asking for personal information;
								impersonating concert ticket sellers, offering tickets to users on social media, and
								then disappearing after receiving
								the transfer, etc.
							</h3>

							<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\Online shopping.png"
										alt="" /></span></div>

							<h3><span class="highlight4">2.1.2 Email scams:</span></h3>

							<h3>This type of scam often involves <span class="highlight5">financial-related
									accounts</span>, where the scammer <span class="highlight5">exploits</span> the
								importance of
								livelihood-related issues and individual privacy, masquerading as an official entity to
								send formal emails to users.<br />
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								Examples include:<br />
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								1.Pretending to be from the tax bureau or Octopus Card Company, alerting users of
								suspicious account transactions (e.g.,
								Fast Transfer),<br />
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								2.Impersonating the Department of Health to distribute or compensate for health
								materials,<br />
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								3.Or notifying users of a prize win and requesting personal information for redemption,
								leading users to click on
								obscure hyperlinks to enter applications and input personal bank account or address
								details.<br />
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								At best, this results in personal information leakage; at worst, it involves trojan
								installation on obscure websites or
								apps, causing losses to users.<br />

								Similarly, there are scams impersonating electronic payment platforms like PayMe,
								indicating that the user has a cash
								gift, which requires clicking on a hyperlink to provide a phone number and a one-time
								SMS code. Once the scammer
								receives this information, they can log into and take control of the user's electronic
								currency account.
							</h3>

							<h3><span class="highlight4">2.1.3 Job scam cases:</span></h3>

							<h3>Predominantly via WhatsApp and social media, it has become especially popular in the
								recent years of economic downturn.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								They generally lure users with <span class="highlight5">low entry requirements</span>
								and <span class="highlight5">high kickbacks</span>, and can be categorized into three
								types:
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								1. Deceiving individuals into giving away personal information under the guise of
								suitable job positions.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								2. Engaging in order manipulation for commission, tempting users to open virtual bank
								accounts to receive salaries and
								profit from their own advanced payments.<br />

								In the second category, users are usually asked to place products in their shopping
								cart, place an order, and then send
								screenshots to the scammer. Users advance the cost of the goods and deposit it into a
								newly opened bank account.
								Initially, the scam group will pay the user's purchase money and commission. Later, they
								abscond with the money advanced
								by the user.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								3. Luring individuals to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
							</h3>
							<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\Online job hunting.png"
										alt="" /></span></div>

							<h3><span class="highlight4">2.1.4Nude chat and online romance scams:</span></h3>

							<h3>These scams typically occur through social media, where during the nude chat, the
								scammer entices the other party to
								download <span class="highlight5">malicious software</span> and obtain <span
									class="highlight5">SMS verification codes</span> to steal their contact information.
								Subsequently, they may
								threaten to send compromising photos obtained during the chat to the victim's family and
								friends for extortion.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								Other tactics include manipulating the victim into transferring money, among other
								methods.
							</h3>
							<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\Online Love.png"
										alt="" /></span></div>
							<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\Naked chat.png" alt="" /></span>
							</div>

							<h3><span class="highlight4">2.1.5 Telephone scams:</span></h3>
							<h3>These are one of the most common and oldest forms of fraud.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								Scammers often impersonate health departments, telecom SIM card real-name registration
								services, immigration
								officials,
								etc., informing users that the service they activated has expired or is illegal, and
								requesting personal information
								to
								assist with <span class="highlight5">investigations</span>. Because users often have
								indeed activated the actual
								service, they are easily deceived into
								disclosing <span class="highlight5">personal information</span>.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								Some extreme scams even impersonate anti-fraud centers. For example, they may pretend to
								be staff members, falsely
								claiming that a citizen's identity has been stolen or that they have intercepted
								remittances stolen by illegal
								organizations, and then demand payment of a processing fee. These scammers often offer
								free anti-fraud legal
								consultations to create confusion and typically connect victims to other organizations,
								such as law firms, to
								increase
								their appearance of legitimacy.
							</h3>

							<h3><span class="highlight4">2.1.6 Financial fraud:</span></h3>
							<h3>Scammers targeting individuals (as opposed to corporate fraud) typically assume two
								kinds of identities.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								The first type is impersonating a financial intermediary with bad intentions or a bank
								clerk, offering low-interest
								loans to users. They contact potential victims via SMS or WhatsApp, often with a no win,
								no fee guarantee to lure
								the
								victims into the trap. Once the user signs the contract, the intermediary company
								charges a high processing fee and
								then
								disappears with the user's principal amount.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								The second type is impersonating a reputable investment firm. For example, they lure
								users into opening accounts on
								fake
								apps for investing in cryptocurrencies. Initially, they may provide small returns or
								show fake profit records, and
								later
								abscond with the users' money. Even more egregiously, some of these fake apps install
								remote control programs to
								steal
								other personal information from the user.
							</h3>
							<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\Online Investment.png"
										alt="" /></span></div>

							<h2>2.2 Summary</h2>
							<h3>Summarizing these traditional types of scams, they generally share four common
								characteristics:
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								1. Initially, the scammer <span class="highlight5">steals identities</span> (social
								engineering scams) to defraud
								the target victims through phishing
								emails, SMS, phone calls, fake websites, or apps.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								2. Scams typically <span class="highlight5">exploit human weaknesses</span> or
								information asymmetries associated
								with the desire for unearned gains.
								The lure of getting something for nothing is often targeted at individuals with lower
								education levels through small
								favors, or at desperate individuals by offering loans. Information asymmetry is commonly
								exploited among people
								unfamiliar with electronic products, such as the elderly, working individuals who lack
								time to shop online, and in
								industries like financial investment and insurance, which have high barriers to entry
								but are highly profitable.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								3. Regarding the purpose of the scam, it is generally to <span class="highlight5">steal
									personal information</span>
								for further extortion of oneself or
								others, or to directly defraud money from the user's account.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								4. A classic tactic is for the scammer to initially act in "good faith," fulfilling
								certain promises to build trust.
								Later, they <span class="highlight5">exploit the victim's trust</span>, hope for luck,
								and habitual behavior to
								directly collect money and then
								disappear.

							<h2>2.3 The new way of fraud based on AI technology: Deepfake</h2>
							<h3><span class="highlight6">2.3.1 Introduction</span></h3>
							<img src="images\SQERP2IoFwQN2fromdetail.gif" alt="" class="wrap-around">
							<div class="space-between1"></div>
							<h3><span class="highlight7">Deepfake technology</span> indeed raises important ethical
								concerns, particularly in the
								areas of <span class="highlight7">privacy</span>, <span
									class="highlight7">security</span>, and
								<span class="highlight7">information authenticity</span>. The ability for individuals to
								create realistic videos
								with relative ease has sparked
								significant debates.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								One of the central issues is the technology's impact on <span class="highlight7">public
									trust</span>. The potential
								for misuse in creating <span class="highlight7">false
									narratives</span> or the unauthorized use of someone's likeness is a growing
								concern. These challenges highlight
								the darker
								side of deepfake capabilities and its potential to influence opinion and spread <span
									class="highlight7">disinformation</span>.
								<div class="space-between1"></div>

								Despite these challenges, deepfake technology also has positive applications. In the
								realm of entertainment, it can
								create engaging content that was previously not possible. In education, it can offer
								novel ways to learn and
								interact
								with educational material. Additionally, it has the potential to restore voices to those
								who have lost them due to
								illness, a truly life-changing application.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								The "Ants Ahoy" video that became popular in mainland China serves as a lighter example
								of deepfake's potential.
								Created
								with the Avatarify mobile app, it demonstrates how the technology can be used for humor
								and entertainment,
								contributing
								to its viral success on social media platforms.
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								It is crucial for the ongoing conversation about deepfakes to balance these
								perspectives. Recognizing both the
								potential
								for harm and the possibility for beneficial innovations is essential as we navigate the
								implications of this
								advancing
								technology.
							</h3>


							<h3><span class="highlight6">2.3.2 The risk of Deepfake</span><br />

								With the proliferation of deepfake technology, seeing is not necessarily believing, and
								having images or videos does not
								guarantee truthfulness. According to a study published in 2008 by University College
								London, deepfakes were rated as one
								of the most threatening AI-related criminal risks. Here are some scenarios where
								deepfakes could be misused:
								<div class="space-between2"></div>
								<details>
									<summary>**Identity Theft**</summary>
									<p>
									<h3>There have been instances where fraudsters forged the voice of the CEO of an
										energy company, instructing subordinates to
										transfer money to a third-party bank account, resulting in a loss of over 2
										million Hong Kong dollars.</h3>
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>**Extortion**</summary>
									<p>
									<h3>Criminals forge videos to threaten the public release of damaging footage for
										extortion.</h3>
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>**Publishing Pornographic Material**</summary>
									<p>
									<h3>Deepfake pornography typically involves swapping the faces of pornographic film
										stars with those of female
										celebrities.
										There are also cases of "revenge porn," where individuals' faces are placed onto
										pornographic actors without
										their
										consent, damaging their reputation.</h3>
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>**Infringement of Intellectual Property and Privacy**</summary>
									<p>
									<h3>Although Hong Kong law does not specify portrait rights, altering images without
										the copyright owner's consent could
										violate copyright laws. Collecting and using someone's personal data for
										identity recognition without their consent is
										also regulated under privacy laws.</h3>
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>**Fake News**</summary>
									<p>
									<h3>Politicians' images are often targeted for parody by netizens, but readers may
										not have the ability to discern real from
										fake. Therefore, the power of politicians using deepfakes to create false
										information and influence public opinion can
										be significant.</h3>
									</p>
								</details>
								<h3><span class="highlight6">2.3.3 Two typical cases of deepfake</span></h3>
								<h3>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\deepfake01.png"
												alt="" /></span></div>
									In 2019, a British energy firm's executive was tricked into transferring €220,000 by
									scammers using AI to mimic their
									CEO's voice and accent. This marked the first known AI-assisted fraud. The
									prevalence of AI technology in Europe and
									America soon led to a rise in similar scams.
									<div class="space-between2"></div>
									In a striking Hong Kong case, a man was deceived into transferring HK$200
									million during a fake AI-generated video call with "executives," showcasing the
									advanced level of AI impersonation used
									by fraudsters.
								</h3>

								<h2>3. Target victim group analysis.</h2>

								<div class="col-4" style="width: 50%;"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\1.png"
											alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" class="wrap-around" /></span>
								</div>
								<h3>
									Research on cybercrime victimization and complaint trends over the past 14 years
									reveals important patterns. Ngo and
									Paternoster (2011) emphasize the role of <span
										class="highlight7">self-control</span> in understanding
									victimization, while Reisig et al. (2009) note
									that <span class="highlight7">perceived risk</span> influences online behavior. The
									analysis of complaint data shows
									cyclical patterns with increasing
									volume but shorter durations, indicating evolving challenges in addressing
									cybercrimes. Since 2008, the growth in
									crime
									numbers has accelerated geometrically, highlighting the need for timely and
									resourceful responses to combat cyber
									threats.
								</h3>

								<div class="space-between3"></div>
								<div class="col-4" style="width: 50%;"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\2.png"
											alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" class="wrap-around" /></span>
								</div>
								<h3>
									In terms of age, <span class="highlight7">older victims</span> are more likely to
									report fraud than younger
									individuals. Time spent on computers,
									<span class="highlight7">familiarity with computers, and technical
										guardianship</span> are factors that determine the cyber victimization of the
									elderly, similar to younger demographics. However, older victims differ in
									characteristics from younger victims.
									Even
									after experiencing cyber fraud, older individuals are less likely to employ
									technical protective measures such as
									camera
									covers, identity theft monitoring, and credit card freezes. For the elderly, the
									likelihood of victimization for
									single
									parents is significantly lower than for those living with a <span
										class="highlight7">partner and children</span>. And <span
										class="highlight7">having a full-time job</span> makes
									them
									more susceptible to experiencing cyber fraud victimization than retirees.
								</h3>

								<div class="space-between3"></div>
								<div class="col-4" style="width: 50%;"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\3.png"
											alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" class="wrap-around" /></span>
								</div>
								<h3>
									The susceptibility of adolescents may be related to factors such as <span
										class="highlight7">lack of
										experience</span> and <span class="highlight7">simple living environments</span>
									(Li and Qu, 2020), while older individuals also have specific vulnerabilities to
									being deceived. Physical
									conditions,
									such as physiological disabilities and impairments, may increase the risk of
									Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive
									impairment, <span class="highlight7">cognitive decline</span>, and depression among
									the elderly, thereby affecting their susceptibility to cyber
									fraud.
									Fear of aging (concerns and fears about social and interpersonal losses associated
									with aging) indirectly influences
									their vulnerability to scams. <span class="highlight7">Loneliness</span> makes older
									individuals more eager to establish social connections, thus
									increasing their willingness to interact with strangers, ultimately leading them
									into the traps set by scammers.
